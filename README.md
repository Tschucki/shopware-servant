<h4> <center>Shopware Plugin Servant </center></h4>

The Shopware Plugin Servant is a CLI tool to help you create and build Shopware 6 plugins. It is based on the Laravel Zero framework. With the Shopware Plugin Servant you can create a plugin much faster. Currently, it can create CMS-Elements and CMS-Blocks within your existing plugins. More features like adding new entities, services, controllers, and much more is under development.\
I created this tool to help me create plugins faster, as I found the process of creating plugins in Shopware 6 very time-consuming. I hope this tool can help you as well.
